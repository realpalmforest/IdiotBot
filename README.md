# IdiotBot

**IdiotBot** is a basic Discord bot built with [Discord.Net](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net) that I made for myself and some friends.

## âœ¨ Features

- **AI Chatbot**
  
  AI chatbot hosted locally using [Ollama](https://ollama.com) with an independent chat in each channel.

- **Wordle**
  
  Wordle recreation directly inside of Discord, which is capable of running an independent session in each channel.

- **GD Demon List**
  
  Cycle through the Geometry Dash demon list which is fetched from the [PointerCrate Rest API](https://pointercrate.com/documentation/index).
